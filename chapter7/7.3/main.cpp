/*Design a class for a widget manufacturing plant. Assuming that 10 widgets may be produced each hour, the class object will calculate
how many days it will take to produce any number of widgets. (The plant operates two 8-hour shifts per day.) Write a program that asks 
the user for the number of widgets that have been ordered and then displays the number of days it will take to produce them. Think about 
what values your program should accept for the number of widgets ordered.*/
